# Supabase credentials (reference)

> **Security:** This file contains a database password. Keep this repository **private**. For production, prefer storing secrets in Vercel Environment Variables (or another secrets manager) and do not commit passwords to git.

## Database password

Used for direct database access (Supabase dashboard, `psql`, or other DB tools).

- **Password:** `ceuxd0hdUCv9lfMx`

Store this in Vercel as `SUPABASE_DATABASE_PASSWORD` if you need it in the deployed app; otherwise use it only when Supabase prompts for the database password.
